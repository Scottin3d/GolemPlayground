# Coding Adventure

Using Unity 2018.4.20f1

## Overview  
This is a personal unity project that I occasionally work on while learning Unity.  I document most of my adventures on my website and development [blog.](https://scottshirley.dev)  

### Game Overview
The player is a golem that rolls around the level trying to cover itself in moss before the other players.  This is a development log for the player creation using a script and
the player controller.  A golem is a rock-troll like creature.  Various versions can be found in games of all genres.
